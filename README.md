playing with openai

# this will be hosted as a web application
# goal of this project is just to mess around with OpenAI to learn the APIs
# also as a python library refresher
# simple web application, should add to it over time, utilizing chatgpt to help with building everything

# ultimately decided not to continue with this project
# requests cost too much for SEC's API at $55 a month, 
# though surprisingly the total cost of requests only cost a little above a $1 for OpenAI's API
# seemed like a cool idea, but this project cost too much to run and host for something that doesn't make any money
